               <p> Accurate marking and measurement is very essential in carpentry work, to produce parts to exact
               size. To transfer dimensions onto the work; the following are the marking and measuring tools
                that are required in a carpentry shop
                </p>
            
            <h3 class="fs-2">Steel Rule and Steel Tape </h3>
            <p>Steel rule is a simple measuring instrument consisting of a long, thin metal strip with a marked
              scale of unit divisions. It is an important tool for linear measurement. Steel tape is used for large
              measurements, such as marking on boards and checking the overall dimensions of the work. </p>

            <h3 class="fs-2">Marking Gauge </h3>
            <p>It is a tool used to mark lines parallel to the edge of a wooden piece. It consists of a square
              wooden stem with a sliding wooden stock (head) on it. On the stem is fitted a marking pin, made
              of steel. The stock is set at any desired distance from the marking point and fixed in position by a
              screw. It must be ensured that the marking pin projects through the stem.  </p>

              about 3 mm and the
              end are sharp enough to make a very fine line. A mortise gauge consists of two pins. In this, it is
              possible to adjust the distance between the pins, to draw two parallel lines on the stock. </p>

          <h3 class="fs-2">Try ‐ Square</h3>
          <p>It is used for marking and testing the squareness and straightness of planed surfaces. It consists
            of a steel blade, fitted in a cast iron stock. It is also used for checking the planed surfaces for
            flatness. Its size varies from 150 to 300 mm, according to the length of the blade. It is less
            accurate when compared to the try‐ square used in the fitting shop.   </p>
